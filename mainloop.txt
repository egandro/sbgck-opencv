Init Phase

    - Get Color Checker Frame
    - Calculate match color <-> detected colors

Common Main Loop Part
    - Get Next Frame
    - Calculate Frame Diff

What do we need?

    - We can detect if a ROI is populated or not with the black color of the diff.
    - We don't do that for every frame, since it might be not needed!

    - Is Token x in ROI y?
    - Where is Token x? (= Is Token x in ROI _all_?)

    - What Token is in ROI y?

    - What Tokens are on the Board? << NEVER NO!
