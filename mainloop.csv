init system,requires refinement: init remote debugger,init UI,,,,
init VFS,"partly done, requires filemanager per platform",,,,VFS,
init camera,40% - no camera parameters,,,,,
init sound system,10% - no camera parameters,,,,Sound Engine,
create game list,requires refinement,VFS + cache + local database,,,,
game list,requires refinement,preview picture + description + tags,,,,
load game,"requires refinement: select number of players, allow to resume a saved game, set some global paramerters: short, medium, long type of game, enable/disable detailed instructions",desktop picture of the game,,,SBGCK Core,
load main board,80%,camera live view,,,SBGCK Core,
load board ROIs,90%,,,,SBGCK Core,
load tokens,"50%, asset based tokens broken, similar contour detection not implemented",,,,SBGCK Core,
board detection status,"reflect the board detection status in the UI, allow the player to recalibrate if it continues to be bad for a while","reflect in a % status the board detection, add UI Buttons to do an active recalibration",Bad Board detection,"callback Script?Text, save the current game for resuming somwhere in greet player",SBGCK Core,
init: greet player,"requires refinement: play some sound, play some text, greet the player, welcome the player back, if there is a savegame tell player about that, prepare for mandatory next steps",,Greet Player,callBack Script?Text,SBGCK Core,
init: create empty frame,"80%, detect board and create an empty reference frame, play some text here with instructions, check if the board could be detected and the empty frame works",,Create Empty Frame,callBack Script?Text,SBGCK Core,
init: create color calibration frame,"5%, ask player to put color calibration card on the board, play some text here with instructions, check if the calibration card could be detected and create mapping for translating camera colors to token colors",,Create Color Calibration,callBack Script?Text,SBGCK Core,
init: restore game,"requires refinement: if there is a savegame players needs to be informed to restore some tokens back on the board, play some text here with instructions, to token detection on known ROIs",,Restore Game,callBack Script?Text,SBGCK Core,
main game loop,"requires refinement: detect/cut board from raw frame, detect remotes (always if enable), answer queries of Javascript",,Main Loop,,,
remove background,"create a diff image from the current frame and the empty frame - increase counter if this is ""bad"" - at this point it is unclear if the remote should be detected on the diff frame or on the cut frame or on the raw frame",,,,,
remote detection,similar to token detection and then distance of the tokens - unsolved: header detection,,,,,
token detection: detect color,detect colors on the cut frame (required by the token),,,,,
token detection: detect shape,"detect shape on the color frame, standard shapes and shape is similar to other shape",,,,,
token detection: asset,detect asset - by using feature detector - verify detection,,,,,
use subboard:, similar to the board detection,,,,,
dice detection: detect subboard,,,Dice Loop,,,
dice detection: setup,what kind of dice should be detected,,,,,
dice detection: roll,wait until player rolled + detect values,,,,,
dice detection: remove diceboard,ask player to remove diceboard + detect,,,,,
